# Bajeti – Non-Technical Overview

## What is Bajeti?

Bajeti is a personal finance web and mobile application designed to help users in emerging markets track income, expenses, and savings. Its goal is to help people build better money habits, have visibility into their financial activity, and make better spending decisions.

The app uses a clean UI combined with a conversational AI interface to guide users through common tasks like logging expenses or viewing savings trends — either manually or via chat.

## Why Bajeti?

- Many tools are too complex or Western-centric
- Most people don’t want a spreadsheet — they want clarity
- Bajeti combines structure + ease of use, without needing fintech literacy
- It’s built with African users in mind, but designed to scale

## Target Users

- Professionals & casual workers, entrepreneurs
- Hustlers, boda drivers, small shopkeepers, mobile money users
- Anyone who wants to see "where their money went" without friction

## How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. **Onboarding** → Set income source(s), basic info
2. **Daily/Weekly Logging** → Income & expenses
3. **View Summary** → By time period or category
4. **Ask AI** → e.g. "How much did I spend on food this week?"
5. **Suggestions** → e.g. “You’ve been saving more this month — keep it up!”
