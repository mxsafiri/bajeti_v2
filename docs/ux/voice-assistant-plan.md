# Voice Assistant Plan

## Overview

Bajeti v2 will incorporate a voice assistant feature to enable hands-free financial management. This document outlines the strategy, technical approach, and implementation plan for the voice assistant component.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Accessibility Enhancement**: Make financial management accessible in situations where visual/manual interaction is limited
2. **Reduced Friction**: Simplify common financial tasks through natural voice commands
3. **Expanded Reach**: Appeal to users who prefer voice interfaces or have accessibility needs
4. **Competitive Differentiation**: Stand out from competitors with advanced voice capabilities

## User Experience Design

### Voice Persona

The Bajeti voice assistant will embody the following characteristics:

- **Name**: "Fin" (short for "Financial Assistant")
- **Personality**: Helpful, knowledgeable, slightly casual but professional
- **Voice Characteristics**: Gender-neutral, clear pronunciation, moderate pace
- **Tone**: Encouraging, non-judgmental, privacy-focused

### Activation Methods

- **Wake Word**: "Hey Fin" or "Bajeti"
- **Manual Activation**: Microphone button in app interface
- **Continuous Listening**: Optional setting for desktop/home environments (with clear privacy controls)

### Interaction Patterns

- **Command-Based**: Direct instructions for specific actions
  - "Add a new expense of $45 for groceries"
  - "What's my dining out budget for this month?"

- **Conversational**: Multi-turn interactions for complex tasks
  - User: "I want to save for a new laptop"
  - Fin: "How much do you need to save and by when?"
  - User: "About $1,500 by December"
  - Fin: "To reach $1,500 by December, you'll need to save $250 per month..."

- **Ambient Updates**: Proactive notifications when requested
  - "Good morning, you have three bills due this week totaling $320"
  - "You've reached 80% of your entertainment budget for this month"

### Multimodal Feedback

- **Voice-Only Responses**: Concise summaries for simple queries
- **Voice + Visual**: Detailed information presented visually with voice overview
- **Confirmation Requests**: Verbal confirmation for critical actions
- **Error Handling**: Clear explanation when commands aren't understood

### Speech Processing

- **Speech-to-Text**: Convert spoken commands to text
  - Options: Web Speech API, Azure Speech Services, Google Speech-to-Text
  - Considerations: Accuracy, language support, latency, cost

- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert system responses to natural speech
  - Options: Web Speech API, Amazon Polly, Google Cloud TTS
  - Considerations: Voice quality, customization, streaming capability

### Natural Language Understanding

- **Intent Recognition**: Identify user's goal from spoken input
  - Core intents: QueryBalance, AddTransaction, CheckBudget, CreateBudget, etc.
  - Implementation: Fine-tuned language model or intent classification system

- **Entity Extraction**: Identify key parameters from user speech
  - Entities: Amount, Category, Date, Account, etc.
  - Implementation: Named entity recognition with financial domain training

- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation state across multiple turns
  - Track referenced entities and intents
  - Handle follow-up questions and clarifications

### Action Execution

- **Command Router**: Direct recognized intents to appropriate handlers
- **Business Logic**: Execute financial operations based on intent and entities
- **Validation**: Verify commands meet business rules before execution
- **Confirmation**: Request explicit confirmation for critical actions

### Response Generation

- **Template-Based**: Pre-defined responses with dynamic value insertion
- **Dynamic Generation**: AI-generated responses for complex or unique situations
- **Personalization**: Adapt responses based on user preferences and history
- **Brevity Control**: Adjust verbosity based on context and user settings
